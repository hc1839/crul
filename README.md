# Chemistry Research Utility Library

## Introduction

Chemistry Research Utility Library (CRUL) is a utility library containing
classes and functions that facilitate day-to-day research tasks in
computational chemistry, such as converting units of measure, representing a
chemical species, rotating coordinates, rudimentary fuzzy numbers, and others.
CRUL is developed in Kotlin and uses Apache Maven for building.


## Building and Installation

`mvn install` builds and installs the library to the local Maven repository.


## Documentation
